# Arduino EEPROM Filebrowser

This tool can be used for Host/Client communication between your Arduino Nano and your PC.
The EEPROM will be mapped into this Programm and be shown to you like a classic Windows Explorer Folder.
Each "File" represents exactly one EEPROM Cell.

Right now this in Development Stage and will be updated. 
There is no support planned for different AVR Chips.
