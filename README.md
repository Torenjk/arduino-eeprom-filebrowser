# Arduino EEPROM Filebrowser

This tool can be used for Host/Client communication between your Arduino Nano and your PC.
The EEPROM will be mapped into this Programm and be shown to you like a classic Windows Explorer Folder.
Each "File" represents exactly one EEPROM Cell.

Right now this in DevelopmentStage and will be updated (aka does not compile right now). 
There is no support planned for different AVR Chips. 

The Code is also a bunch of mess right now, will be organized and documented properly later.
